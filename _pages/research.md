2. **<font color='#994d00'>Speech Activity Detection from Brain Signals</font>** (PI: Dr. Jun Wang): Neural speech decoding-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) or speech-BCI is a novel paradigm for exploring communication restoration for locked-in (fully paralyzed but aware) patients. Speech-BCIs aim to map a direct transformation from neural signals to text or speech, which has the potential for a higher communication rate than the current BCIs. Although recent progress has demonstrated the potential of speech-BCIs from either invasive or non-invasive neural signals, the majority of the systems developed so far still assume knowing the onset and offset of the speech utterances within the continuous neural recordings. This lack of real-time voice/speech activity detection (VAD) is a current obstacle for future applications of neural speech decoding wherein BCI users can have a continuous conversation with other speakers. To address this issue, in this project, an attempt was made to automatically detect the voice/speech activity directly from the neural signals recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) using long short-term memory-recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN). \[[Journal](https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082248)\]
