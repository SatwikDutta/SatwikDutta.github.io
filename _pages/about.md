I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering (Speech/Signal Processing) at the University of Texas at Dallas (**UT Dallas**) under [Dr. John H.L. Hansen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~john.hansen/). I am primarily affiliated with the [Center for Robust Speech Systems](https://crss.utdallas.edu/). My research interests include Digital Signal Processing, Speech Processing, Speech Recognition, Machine Learning, Silent Speech Interfaces, and Speech Disorders. Currently I am working on various algorithms to understand speech and language development in pre-school children.   

I maintain an active collaboration with [Dr. Lisa Goffman](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-lisa-goffman/) and [Dr. Thomas F. Campbell](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-thomas-campbell/) from the [Callier Center for Communication Disorders](https://calliercenter.utdallas.edu/). Previously, I worked with [Dr. Jun Wang](https://csd.utexas.edu/faculty/jun-wang) at the [Speech Disorders & Technology Lab](https://csd.utexas.edu/research/wang-lab/home). Currently, I also serve as the Vice-President of Administration and Erik Jonsson School Representative of the UT Dallas Graduate Student Assembly for the academic year 2020-2021.
