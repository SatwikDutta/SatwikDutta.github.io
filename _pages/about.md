<p style="color:red;font-size:30px">THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</p>

I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas under Dr. John Hansen. I am currently affiliated with the Center for Robust Speech Systems (CRSS). My research interests include Digital Signal Processing, Speech Processing, Speech Recognition, Machine Learning, Silent Speech Interfaces, and Speech Disorders. Currently I am working on various algorithms to understand child speech and language impairments. I also maintain an active collaboration with Dr. Lisa Goffman from the Callier Center for Communication Disorders. Previously, I have worked with Dr. Thomas Campbell from Callier Center on a child speech assessment project.  I started my first research project with Dr. Jun Wang at the Speech Disorders & Technology Lab (SDTL). Currently, I serve as the Vice-President of Administration and Erik Jonsson School Representative of the UT Dallas Graduate Student Assembly for the academic year 2020-2021.
