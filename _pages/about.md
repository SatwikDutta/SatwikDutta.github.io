I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu) (**UT Dallas**) under the supervision of [Dr. John H.L. Hansen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~john.hansen/). I am primarily affiliated with the [Center for Robust Speech Systems](https://crss.utdallas.edu/). My research interests include Speech Processing & Recognition, Machine Learning, and Speech Disorders. Currently I am working on various speech processing algorithms to understand adult-child interactions in naturalistic environments (such as classrooms, households, etc.) and it's applications on early childhood language intervention and beyond. I maintain an active collaboration with [Dr. Dwight Irvin](https://juniper.ku.edu/people/dwight-irvin) and [Dr. Jay Buzhardt](https://juniper.ku.edu/people/buzhardt-jay) from the [Juniper Gardens Children's Project](https://juniper.ku.edu/), a part of the KU Life Span Institute at the University of Kansas.

Previously, I have worked on collaborative projects with [Dr. Lisa Goffman](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-lisa-goffman/) and [Dr. Thomas F. Campbell](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-thomas-campbell/) from the [Callier Center for Communication Disorders](https://calliercenter.utdallas.edu/) at UT Dallas. In 2019, I was fortunate to start my first research journey under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Wang](https://csd.utexas.edu/faculty/jun-wang) at the [Speech Disorders & Technology Lab](https://csd.utexas.edu/research/wang-lab/home), currently at UT Austin. 

Beyond my academic commitments, I currently serve as the Student Council Representative for the Technical Committee on Speech Communication for the [Acoustical Society of America](https://acousticalsociety.org).
