I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu) (**UT Dallas**) under the supervision of [Dr. John H.L. Hansen](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~john.hansen/). I am primarily affiliated with the [Center for Robust Speech Systems](https://crss.utdallas.edu/). My research interests include Speech Processing & Recognition, Machine Learning, and Speech Disorders. Currently I am working on various speech processing algorithms to understand adult-child interactions in naturalistic environments (such as classrooms, households, etc.) and it's applications on early childhood language intervention and beyond. I maintain an active collaboration with [Dr. Dwight Irvin](https://ceecs.education.ufl.edu/about/members/dwight-irvin/) at the University of Florida - [Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies](https://ceecs.education.ufl.edu/), [Dr. Kathy Bigelow](https://lifespan.ku.edu/people/kathy-bigelow) and [Dr. Jay Buzhardt](https://juniper.ku.edu/people/buzhardt-jay) at the University of Kansas - [Juniper Gardens Children's Project](https://juniper.ku.edu/).

Previously, I have worked on collaborative projects with [Dr. Lisa Goffman](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-lisa-goffman/) and [Dr. Thomas F. Campbell](https://utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/dr-thomas-campbell/) at the [Callier Center for Communication Disorders](https://calliercenter.utdallas.edu/) at UT Dallas. I was fortunate to start my first research journey in 2019 under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Wang](https://csd.utexas.edu/faculty/jun-wang) at the [Speech Disorders & Technology Lab](https://csd.utexas.edu/research/wang-lab/home) (currently at UT Austin). 

Beyond my academic commitments, I currently serve as the [Student Council Representative](https://asastudents.org/about/meet-the-student-council/) for the Technical Committee on Speech Communication for the [Acoustical Society of America](https://acousticalsociety.org) and on the [Student Advisory Committee](http://www.isca-students.org/sacweb/) of the [International Speech Communication Association](https://www.isca-speech.org/iscaweb/) as Event and co-Media Co-ordinator.
