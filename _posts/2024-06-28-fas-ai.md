Washington, D.C., Jun 28, 2024 â€“ The time is ripe for AI-related legislation. To help address the serious policy questions posed by AI, the Federation of American Scientists hosted an AI Legislation Policy Sprint to crowdsource, develop, and publish a set of creative AI-focused ideas that could be taken up by Congress. FAS published a final slate of 15 policy memos from experts in artificial intelligence across critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and research and development, addressing themes such as privacy, AI safety, workforce development, and responsible innovation.

The memos on Trust, Safety, and Privacy looked at cutting-edge ways that Congress can foster trust in emerging technologies and mitigate risks from advanced AI systems. Ideas include early warning systems for national security and public safety, considerations for child online privacy in the age of generative AI, and creating an AI Incident Reporting System.

Satwik's memo focused on [Strengthen Childrenâ€™s Online Voice Privacy In The AI Era](https://fas.org/publication/childrens-online-voice-privacy/).
