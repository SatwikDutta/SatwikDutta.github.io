Melville, May 19, 2023 – The Acoustical Society of America (ASA) announced that four projects are the winners of the ASA Special Awards presented at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (Regeneron ISEF). The top three finalists have been awarded cash prizes for their research and all four project finalists are invited to attend an ASA Meeting.

The ASA has participated at ISEF since 1978 to promote acoustics and recognize the accomplishments of high-school students. ASA’s long-time participation in Regeneron ISEF recognizes the importance of promoting STEM education and generating interest in acoustics among all students. This year, the ASA judging team was led by Peter Assmann (University of Texas at Dallas) and included Christopher Ainley (Wrightson, Johnson, Haddon & Williams, Inc.), Satwik Dutta (University of Texas at Dallas), Nursadul Mamun (University of Texas at Dallas), and Abbey Thomas (University of Texas at Dallas).
