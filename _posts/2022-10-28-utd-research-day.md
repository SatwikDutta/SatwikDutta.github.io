The University of Texas at Dallas held its first [Research Day](https://sites.utdallas.edu/researchday/) on Oct. 14 to celebrate the cutting-edge research endeavors taking place across campus. During the poster showcase, more than 60 graduate students presented their research in a wide variety of disciplines to more than 300 attendees. Projects ranged from the characterization of next-generation solar cells and forecasting COVID-19 cases to studies of fracking, wind-generated energy, cancer and autism.

Attendees voted for their favorite presentations, with winners receiving “people’s choice” awards. First place and \\$ 500 went to Nursadul Mamun, a doctoral student in electrical engineering, for his work on techniques to enhance speech intelligibility for cochlear implant users. Yalini Wijesundara, a chemistry doctoral student, earned second place and \\$ 300 for her research on a potential new drug-delivery technology. Third place and \\$ 100 went to Satwik Dutta MS’20, a doctoral student in electrical engineering, for his research on speech-processing tools to study language development in early childhood.
