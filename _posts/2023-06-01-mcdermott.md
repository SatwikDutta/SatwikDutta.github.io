The University’s schools, departments, and programs recruit excellent doctoral students from across the nation and around the world. Each year, some of the most talented of these are named Eugene McDermott Graduate Fellows. The Fellows are distributed among five of UT Dallas’s seven schools, in fields ranging from chemistry to neuroscience and management. Current Fellows hold federally-funded research fellowships, including the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRF), the National Institutes of Health’s National Research Service Award (NIH NRSA) and Blueprint D-SPAN Award, and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science Graduate Student Research (SCGSR) award.
