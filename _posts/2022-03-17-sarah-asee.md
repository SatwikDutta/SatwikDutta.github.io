Mentoring undergraduate students is something Satwik really enjoys, and feels that mentoring is at the core of his professional development. Starting from 2021, Satwik mentored Jacob Reyna, an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering. Jacob was selected as an NSF REU in our Center. In April 2022, Jacob presented his research as a recipient of the 2022 Undergraduate Research Scholar Award!
