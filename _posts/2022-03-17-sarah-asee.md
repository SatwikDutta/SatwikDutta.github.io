Mentoring undergraduate students is something Satwik really enjoys, and feels that mentoring is at the core of his professional development. Starting from 2021, Satwik mentored Sarah Tao, an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering. Sarah was selected as an NSF REU in our Center. In March 2022, Jacob presented her research at [2022 American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Gulf-Southwest (GSW) Section conference](https://www.pvamu.edu/engineering/2022-asee-gsw-conference/) and received the ASEE-GSW UG Student Best Paper Award for 2022! 

Congrats [Sarah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-tao/)!
